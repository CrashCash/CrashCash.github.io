      <h1>Brake fluid supply bottle</h1>
      <img src="front-in-use.jpg">
    </center>
    <p>I do all the maintenance on my bikes by myself, so I need to be a little creative when it comes to replacing brake and clutch fluid,
      as this is usually a two-person job.</p>
    <p>For the caliper end of things, I use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stahlbus-us.com/">Stahlbus bleeder valves</a>. They're far
      superior to SpeedBleeders, and worth the price. (<a href="#discuss">see discussion below</a>)</p>
    <p>For the master cylinder end, I created a cheap brake fluid supply bottle out of a pint Mason canning jar and $30 in computer
      water-cooling parts. It has a valve to open and close it.</p>
    <p>To hold it in place, I use a small plate with a thumbscrew that screws into the same hole that holds on the master cylinder lid.</p>
    <p>I've used pressure bleeders and other equipment, but this is the simplest and cleanest method I've used so far.</p>
    <p>I've used commercial supply bottles, but they're all designed for cars and don't attach well to the master cylinder, and the valves
      are usually very poor quality. They end up leaking fluid everywhere, and make more of a mess and hassle than they save.</p>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>Close the valve, then flip the bottle over.</p>
    <p>The thumbscrew simply threads into one of the master cylinder lid screw holes with the standard M4 thread used by all Japanese bikes
      - and the Italian and German ones I've run into as well.</p>
    <p>Open the valve. As the fluid drops below the barb, air bubbles into the bottle, which releases fluid to raise the level back up to
      the bottom of the barb. It's the same principle as Harbor Freight or Mityvac bottles, but it <i>actually works.</i></p>
    <h1>Required PC water cooling parts:</h1>
    <p>I bought mine from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.performance-pcs.com/">Performance PCs</a> so I will use their prices and part
      numbers. Except for the ball valve, they're generic parts.</p>

        affected by brake fluid.

    </div>
    <br>
    <p>This image shows the assembly order.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The first piece is the nut to bulkhead fitting. This has a flat side with a small recess meant to capture the o-ring. Make sure this
        nut is oriented properly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next is the o-ring that goes between the nut and the lid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drill the center of the "Tough Tops" plastic lid with a step bit (also known as a unibit) to accept the bulkhead fitting. This is
        the best way to cut the thin plastic of the lid.<br>
        After you cut the hole, flip the lid over and lightly touch the bit to the plastic to remove any sharp burrs.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is another o-ring between the lid and the bulkhead fitting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Screw a nozzle coupling adapter on the bulkhead fitting. It has its own pair of o-rings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Screw the ball valve to the coupling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Screw the other nozzle coupling adapter onto the other end of the ball valve.
      </li>
      <li>
        Screw the pass-through onto the coupling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the threaded collar, fit the 3D-printed plate, and screw the collar back on.
      </li>
      <li>
        Screw the short barb fitting to the pass-through.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A note about SpeedBleeders vs. Stahlbus bleeders</h3>
    <p>SpeedBleeders are brake bleeder nipples with spring-loaded one-way check-valve balls. They're a nice idea.</p>
    <p>The problem is when you loosen them to release the check-valves, fluid leaks out and air is sucked in past the threads where they
      screw into the caliper.</p>
    <p>You can work around this by smearing grease around the threads or other methods, but it's still kind of a mess.</p>
    <p>With Stahlbus bleeders, the nipple with the check-valve screws into an O-ring sealed chamber, which then screws solidly into the
      caliper. No leaks.</p>
    <p>Another advantage of the design is that you can control how loose the valve is, and how easily it passes fluid. You can even loosen
      them enough to fill the system through the bleeders.</p>
