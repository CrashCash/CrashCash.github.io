    <h1>Brake fluid supply bottle</h1>
    <p>I do all the maintenance on my bikes by myself, so I need to be a little creative when it comes to replacing brake and clutch fluid, as this is usually a
      two-person job.</p>
    <p>For the caliper end of things, I use <a href="https://www.stahlbus-us.com/" target="_blank">Stahlbus bleeder valves</a>. These are superior to
      SpeedBleeders, and worth the price. (<a href="#discuss">see discussion below</a>)</p>
    <p>For the master cylinder end, I created a cheap brake fluid supply bottle out of a pint Mason canning jar and $30 in computer water-cooling parts. It has
      a valve to open and close it.</p>
    <p>To hold it in place, I use RAM Mount hardware, as it's flexible enough to fit anywhere on any bike, and I already have a ton of it.</p>
    <p>I've used pressure bleeders and other equipment, but this is the simplest and cleanest method I've used so far.</p>
    <p>I've used commercial supply bottles, but they're all designed for cars and don't attach well to the master cylinder, and the valves are usually very poor
      quality. They end up leaking fluid everywhere, and make more of a mess and hassle than they save.</p>

    <h3>3D-printed lid with nipple:</h3>
    <p>The 3D-printed lid gets rid of a leaky O-ring seal, and is far sturdier than the standard thin sheet-metal lid.<br>
      Right-click and save the <a href="brake_fluid_lid_nozzle.stl">brake_fluid_lid_nozzle.stl</a> file for slicing and printing.<br>
      I used PETG filament on an original Prusa i3 MK3 printer. Don't use PLA or ABS since they aren't compatible with brake fluid.</p>

    <h3>Required PC water cooling parts:</h3>
    <p>I bought mine from <a href="http://www.performance-pcs.com/" target="_blank">Performance PCs</a> so I will use their prices and part numbers. Except for
      the ball valve, they're generic parts.</p>

          Do not get the "stubby" style fitting
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>If you're not going to use the 3D-printed lid, you will also need the following part, plus another barb fitting:</p>
    <table cellpadding="4">
      <tr>
        <td><img src="xs-pc-chrome-bulkhead.jpg" style="height:100px;"></td>
        <td>
          XSPC-G14-BULK-SL ($5)<br>
          XSPC G1/4" to G1/4" bulkhead fitting
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      To install this fitting in the standard sheet-metal jar lid:
      <ul>
        <li>Use a unibit (step bit) to drill a clean hole in the center of the lid.</li>
        <li>The bulkhead fitting comes with 2 O-rings. Make sure one is installed on each side of the lid.</li>
        <li>The nut has a flat side with a small recess meant to capture the O-ring. Make sure this nut is oriented properly.</li>
        <li>Screw the barb fitting in so that its O-ring is against the flat part of the bulkhead fitting so it seals. This means the bulkhead fitting nut
          should be inside the bottle.</li>
        <li>Do not overtighten, as you don't want to squash the O-rings. Nothing should be beyond finger-tight.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Other required parts:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Pint size standard-mouth smooth Mason jar.<br>
        Do not get Ball jars. They have all sorts of decorations that cause problems with cracking, including their "smooth" ones. Also, their smallest pack is
        a dozen jars.<br>
        I got Anchor-Hocking jars, which are truly smooth and are available in 6-packs at my local Publix.</li>
      <li>#56 (3-1/16"-4") band clamp to attach RAM Mount to jar.</li>
      <li><img src="hose_clamp.jpg" align="middle"> SAE #15 14mm-16mm automotive fuel-injection hose clamps - 2 required.</li>
      <li>Short length of 1/2" clear hose - 3" or 4" is fine.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Bottle Assembly:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Attach barb fitting to each end of the ball valve.</li>
      <li>Slip the two automotive clamps over the hose, and put the hose over one ball valve fitting, and the fitting on the Mason jar lid.</li>
      <li>Clamp each end of the hose with the automotive clamps. Having the hose slip off would be a huge mess.</li>
      <li>Attach the RAM Mount to the side of the bottle with the large band clamp. Do not tighten the clamp too much. It's probably a good idea to tighten it
        and back off half a turn.</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>
    <h3>Front Brake</h3>
    The shoulder of the valve should rest on the edge of the reservoir, so the barb fitting creates a lower fluid level so it doesn't overflow.<br>
    As the fluid drops below the barb, air bubbles into the bottle, which releases fluid to raise the level back up to the bottom of the barb.<br><br>
    The bottle attached to the claw on the handlebar. I could also use the permanent mount I use for the electronic toll pass.<br>

    <h3>A note about SpeedBleeders vs. Stahlbus bleeders</h3>
    <p>SpeedBleeders are brake bleeder nipples with spring-loaded one-way check-valve balls. They're a nice idea.</p>
    <p>The problem is when you loosen them to release the check-valves, fluid leaks out and air is sucked in past the threads where they screw into the caliper.</p>
    <p>You can work around this by smearing grease around the threads or other methods, but it's still kind of a mess.</p>
    <p>With Stahlbus bleeders, the nipple with the check-valve screws into an O-ring sealed chamber, which then screws solidly into the caliper. No leaks.</p>
    <p>Another advantage of the design is that you can control how loose the valve is, and how easily it passes fluid. You can even loosen them enough to fill
      the system through the bleeders.</p>
