    <h1>Brake fluid supply bottle</h1>
    <p>I do all the maintenance on my bikes by myself, so I need to be a little creative when it comes to replacing brake and clutch fluid, as this is usually a
      two-person job.</p>
    <p>For the caliper end of things, I use <a href="https://www.stahlbus-us.com/" target="_blank">Stahlbus bleeder valves</a>. These are superior to
      SpeedBleeders, and worth the price. (<a href="#discuss">see discussion below</a>)</p>
    <p>For the master cylinder end, I created a cheap brake fluid supply bottle out of a pint Mason canning jar and $30 in computer water-cooling parts. It has
      a valve to open and close it.</p>
    <p>To hold it in place, I use RAM Mount hardware, as it's flexible enough to fit anywhere on any bike, and I already have a ton of it.</p>
    <p>I've used pressure bleeders and other equipment, but this is the simplest and cleanest method I've used so far.</p>
    <p>I've used commercial supply bottles, but they're all designed for cars and don't attach well to the master cylinder, and the valves are usually very poor
      quality. They end up leaking fluid everywhere, and make more of a mess and hassle than they save.</p>

    <h3>3D-printed lid with nipple:</h3>
    <p>The 3D-printed lid gets rid of a leaky O-ring seal, and is far sturdier than the standard thin sheet-metal lid.<br>
      Right-click and save the files for slicing and printing:<br>

      I used PETG filament on an original Prusa i3 MK3 printer. Don't use PLA or ABS since they aren't compatible with brake fluid.</p>

    <p>I bought mine from <a href="http://www.performance-pcs.com/" target="_blank">Performance PCs</a> so I will use their prices and part numbers. Except for
      the ball valve, they're generic parts.</p>

    <h3>Other required parts:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Two pint size standard-mouth smooth Mason jars.<br>
        Do not get Ball jars. They have all sorts of decorations that cause problems with cracking, including their "smooth" ones. Also, their smallest pack is
        a dozen jars.<br>
        I got Anchor-Hocking jars, which are truly smooth and are available in 6-packs at my local Publix.</li>
      <li>#56 (3-1/16"-4") band clamp to attach RAM Mount to jar.</li>
      <li><img src="hose_clamp.jpg" align="middle">Two SAE #15 14mm-16mm automotive fuel-injection hose clamps.</li>
      <li>Short length of 1/2" clear hose - 3" or 4" is fine.</li>
      <li>VESA monitor mount thumbscrew with M4 thread</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Front Bottle Assembly:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The bulkhead fitting comes with 2 O-rings. Make sure one is installed on each side of the 3D-printed lid with the hole in it.</li>
        <li>The nut has a flat side with a small recess meant to capture the O-ring. Make sure this nut is oriented properly.</li>
        <li>Screw the barb fitting in so that its O-ring is against the flat part of the bulkhead fitting so it seals. This means the bulkhead fitting nut
          should be inside the bottle.</li>
        <li>Do not overtighten, as you don't want to squash the O-rings. Nothing should be beyond finger-tight.</li>
        <li>Screw a nozzle coupling adapter on each end of the ball valve.</li>
        <li>Screw the ball valve assembly onto the bulkhead fitting on the lid.</li>
        <li>Unscrew the collar from the pass-through and screw the pass-through onto the other end of the ball valve so the threaded part faces away from the
          valve.</li>
        <li>Place the 3D-printed support plate on the pass-through and screw the collar back down.</li>
        <li>Screw a barb fitting onto the pass-through,</li>
        <li>Thread the thumbscrew into the other hole on the support plate.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Rear Bottle Assembly:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Attach a barb fitting to each end of the ball valve.</li>
      <li>Slip the two automotive clamps over the hose, and put the hose over one ball valve fitting, and onto the 3D-printed lid with the nipple.</li>
      <li>Clamp each end of the hose with the automotive clamps.</li>
      <li>Attach the RAM Mount rail base to the side of the bottle with the large band clamp.<br>
        Do not tighten the clamp too much.<br>
        It's probably a good idea to tighten it and back off half a turn.</li>

    <h3>Front Brake</h3>
    Close the valve, then flip the bottle over.<br>
    The thumbscrew simply threads into one of the master cylinder lid screw holes with the standard M4 thread used by all Japanese bikes, then you open the valve.<br>
    As the fluid drops below the barb, air bubbles into the bottle, which releases fluid to raise the level back up to the bottom of the barb.<br>
    <img src="front-in-use.jpg">
    <p></p>
    <h3>Rear Brake</h3>
    The rear brake bottle uses the flexible hose to reach the master cylinder reservoir tucked into the frame.<br>
    This setup uses the RAM Mount claw on the footpeg, plus the PVC pipe extension.<br>
    <img src="rear-claw-footpeg.jpg">
    <p></p>
    This setup uses the RAM Mount claw on the passenger peg, plus the 6" arm.<br>
    <img src="rear-claw-passpeg.jpg">
    <p></p>
    Here is the RAM Mount glare shield clamp on the passenger peg frame rail.<br>
    The clamping screws have rubber tips to protect the paint.
    <img src="glare-shield-clamp.jpg">
    <p></p>
    This is how you can use the glare shield clamp, the 3" and 6" arms, and the double-ball adapter.<br>

    <h3>A note about SpeedBleeders vs. Stahlbus bleeders</h3>
    <p>SpeedBleeders are brake bleeder nipples with spring-loaded one-way check-valve balls. They're a nice idea.</p>
    <p>The problem is when you loosen them to release the check-valves, fluid leaks out and air is sucked in past the threads where they screw into the caliper.</p>
    <p>You can work around this by smearing grease around the threads or other methods, but it's still kind of a mess.</p>
    <p>With Stahlbus bleeders, the nipple with the check-valve screws into an O-ring sealed chamber, which then screws solidly into the caliper. No leaks.</p>
    <p>Another advantage of the design is that you can control how loose the valve is, and how easily it passes fluid. You can even loosen them enough to fill
      the system through the bleeders.</p>
