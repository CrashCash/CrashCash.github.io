      <h1>Brake fluid supply bottle</h1>

    <p>I do all the maintenance on my bikes by myself, so I need to be a little creative when it comes to replacing brake and clutch fluid,
      as this is usually a two-person job.</p>
    <p>For the caliper end of things, I use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stahlbus-us.com/">Stahlbus bleeder valves</a>. These are
      superior to SpeedBleeders, and worth the price. (<a href="#discuss">see discussion below</a>)</p>
    <p>For the master cylinder end, I created a cheap brake fluid supply bottle out of a pint Mason canning jar and $30 in computer
      water-cooling parts. It has a valve to open and close it.</p>
    <p>To hold it in place, I use a small plate with a thumbscrew that screws into the same hole that holds on the master cylinder lid.</p>
    <p>I've used pressure bleeders and other equipment, but this is the simplest and cleanest method I've used so far.</p>
    <p>I've used commercial supply bottles, but they're all designed for cars and don't attach well to the master cylinder, and the valves
      are usually very poor quality. They end up leaking fluid everywhere, and make more of a mess and hassle than they save.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>Close the valve, then flip the bottle over.</p>
    <p>The thumbscrew simply threads into one of the master cylinder lid screw holes with the standard M4 thread used by all Japanese bikes,
      then you open the valve.</p>
    <p>As the fluid drops below the barb, air bubbles into the bottle, which releases fluid to raise the level back up to the bottom of the
      barb.</p>

    <p>I bought mine from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.performance-pcs.com/">Performance PCs</a> so I will use their prices and part
      numbers. Except for the ball valve, they're generic parts.</p>

          Do not overtighten, as you don't want to squash the o-rings. Nothing should be beyond finger-tight.

    <h3>A note about SpeedBleeders vs. Stahlbus bleeders</h3>
    <p>SpeedBleeders are brake bleeder nipples with spring-loaded one-way check-valve balls. They're a nice idea.</p>
    <p>The problem is when you loosen them to release the check-valves, fluid leaks out and air is sucked in past the threads where they
      screw into the caliper.</p>
    <p>You can work around this by smearing grease around the threads or other methods, but it's still kind of a mess.</p>
    <p>With Stahlbus bleeders, the nipple with the check-valve screws into an O-ring sealed chamber, which then screws solidly into the
      caliper. No leaks.</p>
    <p>Another advantage of the design is that you can control how loose the valve is, and how easily it passes fluid. You can even loosen
      them enough to fill the system through the bleeders.</p>
