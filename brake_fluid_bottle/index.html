    <h1>Brake fluid supply bottle</h1>
    <p>I do all the maintenance on my bikes by myself, so I need to be a little creative when it comes to replacing brake and clutch fluid, as this is usually a
      two-person job.</p>
    <p>For the caliper end of things, I use <a href="https://www.stahlbus-us.com/" target="_blank">Stahlbus bleeder valves</a>. These are far superior to
      SpeedBleeders, and worth the price. (<a href="#discuss">see discussion below</a>)</p>
    <p>For the master cylinder end, I created a cheap brake fluid supply bottle out of a Mason jar and about $40 in computer water-cooling parts.</p>
    <p>To use it:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Center the handlebars so the master cylinder is mostly level.</li>
      <li>Get as much of the old fluid out of the master cylinder as you can.</li>
      <li>Fill the jar with brake fluid and put on the cap with the valving attached.</li>
      <li>Close the ball valve and flip it over.</li>
      <li>Bolt it to the master cylinder with the M4 cap-head bolt. Finger-tight is fine.</li>
      <li>Open the ball valve. The master cylinder will fill until it hits the bottom of the valve.</li>
      <li>Open the Stahlbus bleeder.</li>
      <li>Now you can just pump the lever until all the bubbles and dirty fluid have come out.</li>
      <li>Close the Stahlbus bleeder and the ball valve.</li>
      <li>Unbolt the jar from the master cylinder.</li>
      <li>Replace the lid on the master cylinder.</li>
      <li>You're done!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I've used pressure bleeders and other equipment, but this is the cleanest method I've used so far.</p>
    <p>I've used commercial supply bottles, but they're all designed for cars and don't attach well to the master cylinder, and the valves are usually very poor
      quality. They end up leaking fluid everywhere, and make more of a mess and hassle than they save.</p>

    <p>Also needed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mason canning jar (pint)</li>
      <li>1/8&quot; thick aluminum plate for bracket</li>
      <li>M4x0.7 allen cap screw for bracket<br>
        It fits lid screw-holes in Japanese-made master cylinder reservoir.<br>
        I got mine from Lowe's.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Bottle Assembly:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Attach coupling adapter to both ends of ball valve.</li>
      <li>Attach bulkhead fitting to one end.</li>
      <li>Attach pass-through to the other end.</li>
      <li>Find center of mason jar lid and drill a 5/8&quot; hole.<br>
        It's best to use a step bit, which are meant to cut clean holes in thin sheetmetal.</li>
      <li>Insert bulkhead fitting in this hole, add o-ring, and tighten.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Screw-on Bracket Assembly:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Drill a 13/16&quot; hole in aluminum plate about 1/2" from center of the long edge.<br>
        Again, you want to use the step bit.<br>
        This is for the valve & bottle.</li>
      <li>Drill a 5/32&quot; hole about 3/16" from the center of the other long edge.<br>
        An ordinary bit will do.<br>
        This is for the M4 screw that will thread into the master cylinder reservoir.</li>
      <li>Cut aluminum plate to 1-1/2"x2" for bracket.<br>
        Clean up the sharp edges and corners with a file, or a flappy abrasive wheel on a bench grinder.</li>
      <li>Insert valving in large hole and tighten nut.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can remove the bracket for the rear brakes, which usually have a round threaded cap. If the rear brake proves to be difficult, you can buy another
      master cylinder lid and drill a 13/16&quot; hole in it, plus another small hole to admit air.</p>

    <h3>A note about SpeedBleeders vs. Stahlbus bleeders</h3>
    <p>SpeedBleeders are brake bleeder nipples with spring-loaded one-way check-valve balls. They're a nice idea.</p>
    <p>The problem is when you loosen them to release the check-valves, fluid leaks out and air is sucked in past the threads where they screw into the caliper.</p>
    <p>You can work around this by smearing grease around the threads or other methods, but it's still kind of a mess.</p>
    <p>With Stahlbus bleeders, the nipple with the check-valve screws into an o-ring sealed chamber, which then screws solidly into the caliper. No leaks.</p>
    <p>Another advantage of the design is that you can control how loose the valve is, and how easily it passes fluid. You can even loosen them enough to fill
      the system through the bleeders.</p>
