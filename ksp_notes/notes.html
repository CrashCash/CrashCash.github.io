    <h1>Kerbal Space Program Notes</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>It's not often that I conserve angular momentum, but when I do, I prefer MechJeb two-dot-oh.<br>
        I guarantee it will give you that fresh feeling all the way to apoapse, or your &Delta;V back.<br>
        Stay efficient my friends.</li>
      <li>We choose to go to the M&uuml;n in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are fun.<br>
        &mdash;John Fitzgerald Kerman</li>
      <li>You're <b><i>on my crew.</i></b> Why are we still talking about this?<br>
        &mdash;Mal Kerman</li>
      <li>Don't worry about me, Bill,<br>
        But, how can I not?<br>
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Q03O-F4fE">Because we are star stuff.</a></li>
      <li>I am a leaf on the wind. Watch how I soar.</li>
      <li>Jeb needs to get out there and show 'em how it's done.</li>
      <li>Much like alcohol, Hyperedit has a time and a place as long as you don't abuse it. Hyperedit responsibly!</li>
      <li>Did you hear about Jeb's, Bill's and Bob's new band? It's called "Orbital Manoeuvres in the Dark!"  (If you leave, don't look back!)</li>
      <li>Some people talk about bringing a dog along on the first manned Mars mission. I'm not sure the public will be impressed with another Mars Rover.</li>
      <li>What did Jeb say when he saw the Monolith? "It's full of snacks!"</li>
      <li><i>Quod viride est facilis</i> - It's not easy being green</li>
      <li>Was that a landing or were we just shot down?</li>
      <li>If you can walk away, it was a good landing. If you can reuse the rocket, it was a great landing.</li>
      <li>You don’t need to call and close your flight plan because they just heard you land.</li>
      <li>Normally we don't judge landings on the Richter scale.
      <li>The next KSP DLC is going to be "Grand Theft Rover" (I keed, I keed!)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Facts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/">KSP wiki</a> is worth reading.</li>
      <li>Synchronous orbit for <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbin">Kerbin</a> is 2863.33km. It's easier to get a 6 hour (1
        Kerbal day) orbital period than to try to hit this value exactly.</li>
      <li>Kerbal days are 6 hours long. Kerbal years are 426 Kerbal days. That's 106.5 Earth days, or 3.5 Earth months, so there are 3.43 Kerbal years in an
        Earth year.</li>
      <li>MechJeb has no problem with locked staging, so be safe and hit right-shift-L immediately after launch.</li>
      <li>Saved games are in their own subdirs under the "saves" directory. There are backups in the "Backup" directory of each game.</li>
      <li>The atmosphere of Kerbin goes up to 70km.</li>
      <li>To raise apoapsis, burn prograde at periapsis. Likewise, to raise periapsis, burn prograde at apoapsis.</li>
      <li>When you're doing a planetary transfer, ALWAYS do a fine-tune after you exit the current SOI. Set the approach distance as high as possible for a
        high orbit where you can cheaply do plane changes.</li>
      <li>When undocking, use Smart-A.S.S. to orient radial minus to prevent recontact. Turn off Smart-A.S.S. before undocking.</li>
      <li>Use the CG indicator in the VAB to put the RCS as close to the CG as possible. To test your RCS setup, go to the launch pad and use the debug menu to
        "hack gravity" which turns it off. You can then fire your RCS translation thrusters and see if you get any unwanted rotational coupling without having
        to go all the way into orbit.</li>
      <li>Use seperatrons firing backwards as retrorockets to deorbit used stages. Put them in the same stage as the decoupler.</li>
      <li>To transfer fuel, right-shift-right-click the fuel tanks. You should get little quantity windows with In/Out buttons.<br>
        You can't transfer across a heatshield with "Resource Transfer Obeys Crossfeed Rules" in effect.</li>
      <li>When a kerbal is on a ladder, shift-WASD makes him look (and jump) in that direction.</li>
      <li>If you ever plan on using parachutes more than once (such as landing on Duna, then landing back at Kerbin), make an action group for "deploy
        chutes". Once you repack a chute, the previous staging won't ever work again. Doing a save/reload will sometimes put your re-packed parachutes back in
        the staging sequence.</li>
      <li>If you alt-click to copy a strut, the strut you place down will automatically connect in the same way that the original strut was connected. It also
        works with fuel lines.</li>
      <li>Using a couple of lights near your docking port to illuminate the port you are docking to is very handy when you are rendezvousing on the dark side of
        planets/moons.</li>
      <li>Disable the front brakes. This will prevent a rover from flipping over when coming to a stop.</li>
      <li>To remove symmetry from a part, remove the "sym = foo" lines in the .craft file</li>
      <li>For interplanetary transfers, use an initial orbit of 650km so you can warp as fast as possible. Or just warp in the tracking station or space
      center.</li>
      <li>Put a thermometer on everything! It doesn't cost anything and grabs those wacky science contracts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>FVWM workaround to release function keys</h3>
    <p>The FVWM config line to release defined function keys doesn't work as documented. The man page says: "A '--' action indicates that the event should be
      propagated to the specified window to handle." but that isn't true. Any already-defined keys are executed instead, so none of the in-game function keys
      work. I stumbled on the workaround entirely by chance.</p>
    <p>Place the following in your ~/.fvwm/config file:</p>
    <code>
      Key (Kerbal*Program) F1  W A FuncUseless<br>
      Key (Kerbal*Program) F2  W A FuncUseless<br>
      Key (Kerbal*Program) F3  W A FuncUseless<br>
      Key (Kerbal*Program) F4  W A FuncUseless<br>
      Key (Kerbal*Program) F5  W A FuncUseless<br>
      Key (Kerbal*Program) F6  W A FuncUseless<br>
      Key (Kerbal*Program) F7  W A FuncUseless<br>
      Key (Kerbal*Program) F8  W A FuncUseless<br>
      Key (Kerbal*Program) F9  W A FuncUseless<br>
      Key (Kerbal*Program) F10 W A FuncUseless<br>
      Key (Kerbal*Program) F11 W A FuncUseless<br><br>

      DestroyFunc FuncUseless<br>
      AddToFunc FuncUseless<br>
      + I Echo FuncUseless
    </code>
    <p>... and no, I have no idea why it works. FuncUseless gets called, but it does NOT consume the keystroke.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>"Spikies" (handles) symbols have the same meaning as the nav ball symbols.</li>
      <li>Unselected nodes appear as small brown asterisks</li>
      <li>The node adds a brown (or purple for a second node) projected trajectory path to the map when you pull/push any of the handles. Pulling the handles
        represent a burn in that direction. You can use the mouse scroll wheel for finer adjustments.</li>
      <li>Maneuver nodes add a blue target to the attitude ball, or a blue arrow if it's not visible.</li>
      <li>To delete a node, right-click the center circle and click the red close button that appears.</li>
      <li>You can drag nodes along your trajectory.</li>
      <li>When landing on bodies with no atmosphere, whack a maneuver node at ground level and adjust it fully retrograde until the resultant is zero. You
        can suicide burn every time, and not have to worry about fuel wastage. Or you can use the "BetterBurnTime" mod.</li>
      <li>A perigee marker does not show up until you have a perigee above the surface.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Orbital maneuvers in the dark</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>High-latitude moon mission from Woomerang:
        <ul>
          <li>Launch into a low 75km orbit. You'll end up in a 45&deg; inclined orbit.</li>
          <li>Create a node and target the moon you're interested in.</li>
          <li>Open the maneuver node editor and use "Snap node to AN/DN with target". Pick whichever one is closest to an intercept.</li>
          <li>Push the apogee out to the target's orbit.</li>
          <li>Use the "+o" to advance orbits until you get an intercept.</li>
          <li>Tab to focus the target. You'll notice you will end up in a polar orbit of the target.</li>
          <li>Back off the prograde &Delta;V until the orbit is just inside the target's SOI. This will make the upcoming inclination change as cheap as
            possible.</li>
          <li>Make sure you have Kerbal Alarm Clock installed. Go to the space center and warp until your maneuver. You don't want to wait for the slow
            low-altitude warp.</li>
          <li>After the injection burn, create a "burn to fine-tune approach" at 750km, use the radial+ button to make the final orbit as low-inclination as
            possible, then add to the prograde burn to raise the inital periapsis.</li>
          <li>You want to make the initial orbit as high as possible, to conserve fuel and make the final plane change as cheap as possible.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NathanKell/RealSolarSystem/wiki/Equatorial-Orbits-from-Non-Equatorial-Launch-Sites">Equatorial orbits from
          non-equatorial launch sites:</a>
        <ul>
          <li>Make a dogleg during ascent. Basically you yaw some during ascent, making a "dogleg" or kink in your ascent trajectory. You can use this to change
            your ascent azimuth, and thus inclination; it is, however, more useful for increasing than decreasing inclination, since the impetus for your
            inclination comes from gravity's pull due to your offset from the equator, and thus builds throughout your ascent until you reach the equator.</li>
          <li>For geostationary launches: launch into a parking orbit, then insert into geostationary transfer orbit at the lowest AN/DN. This will ensure you
            arrive at geosynchronous height at the DN/AN (respectively) and can thus combine plane change with your apogee kick (circularization). This is more
            efficient than circularizing and then performing the plane change, since (1) you burn along the hypotenuse of the triangle rather than two sides
            (and thus escape cosine losses) and (2) compared to a plane change after apogee kick, you are at a lower orbital velocity and thus the plane change
            is cheaper. It is for that reason also much, much cheaper than making a plane change burn in your parking orbit.</li>
          <li>If launching from very high latitudes (the break-even point is about 45 degrees IIRC), you can launch into a super-synchronous orbit and perform a
            bi-elliptic transfer. You actually burn for a much higher apogee, and do your plane change there (cost of higher apogee + cheaper plane change +
            circularization burn to bring your apogee down &lt; more expensive plane change). Then you move your perigee to the desired orbit's apogee, and
            finally you circularize at perigee.</li>
          <li>Launched a Kerbal X from Woomerang into 77x72 orbit at 45.3 degrees, leaving 2,473 units of fuel, then saved game.<br>
            Mission: 1,000 km equatorial orbit using minimum fuel
            <ol>
              <li>Plane change, then burn to final orbit - 45 units fuel left (2,428 consumed)</li>
              <li>Burn to final orbit apoapsis at lowest AN/DN with a plane change, then circularize - 168 units fuel left (2,305 consumed)</li>
              <li>Burn to final orbit, then plane change - 405 units fuel left (2,068 consumed)</li>
              <li>Burn to final orbit apoapsis at lowest AN/DN, then circularize with a plane change - 695 units fuel left (1,778 consumed)</li>
            </ol>
        </ul>

    <h3>Joystick</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To avoid conflict with mouse/keys, edit /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-joystick.conf and add:<br>
        Option "StartKeysEnabled" "False"<br>
	Option "StartMouseEnabled" "False"</li>
      <li>Joystick must be connected before running KSP</li>

      <li>Space - Reset rotations</li>
      <li>Left Shift - Rotate 5&deg; instead of 90&deg;</li>
      <li>Bug workaround: If rocket parts don't clip on radially, snap them inline first.</li>

      <li>There's a memorial to the old Mk. 1 pod behind the VAB.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Career</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To add funds, edit the "funds =" line in the SFS save-files, or use the "Funding" buttons in the debug menu cheat screen.</li>
      <li>To unlock a part, change the "unlockTechs" and "TechRequired" to "start", and set all the "entryCost" entries to "0" in the part.cfg, then go to the
        R&amp;D center and research them all.</li>
      <li>For contracts, "expires" means how long the contract is available to accept, and "duration" is how long you have to complete the requirements.</li>
      <li>The "enter orbit" contracts have a minimum orbital altitude. If this hasn't fired, raise your orbit.</li>
      <li>After you enter orbit, look for a "science in orbit" contract, even if you already have an "explore" contract which includes science in orbit. It's
        nice to get paid twice.</li>
      <li>After landing, grab a "plant flag" contract (and a flag!) before EVA.</li>
      <li>To rescue a kerbal in orbit, use the Klaw on his pod, and transfer him over. This avoids EVA.</li>
      <li>If you have to do something in an "area" or "site" then you can click the mapview icon to "start navigation" which will give you a direction
        indicator on the nav-ball, and tell you when you're entering the site.</li>
      <li>When putting satellites in specific orbits, pay attention to the orbit direction arrows!</li>
      <li>To upgrade all facilities, use the "maximum facility" button in the debug menu cheat screen.</li>
    </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Needs a crew including a scientist, a manned pod/probe core on the same craft, an antenna, and continuous electricity.</li>
        <li>You can plunk data in even if you have no more normal science to gain (otherwise it would limit what you could use based on when you got the lab
          unlocked).</li>
        <li>You get a data bonus if you are on the ground vs orbit.</li>
        <li>You get a data bonus if the lab is on/around the same body the science came from.</li>
        <li>Landed on Kerbin actually gets a penalty.</li>
        <li>You can in fact generate infinite science, provided you're willing to invest in the infrastructure and time. That being said, there is no recovery
          bonus. You would have to wait it out and convert that data to science and transmit it over time.</li>
        <li>Science rate is based on scientists and how much data you have. Non-scientists just eat the experiments.</li>
        <li>1 data becomes 5 science.</li>
        <li>Each lab can, in it's lifetime, research only one copy of any single unique experiment result. Goo at the poles and Goo over the grasslands are two

            Transfers Replaced with Bi-Impulsive Transfers</a><br>
            So as a "weekend project" I replaced the Hohmann Transfer planner to turn it into a proper bi-impulsive optimal transfer planner (the generalized
            Hohmann transfer problem).<br>
            This is bi-impulsive -- not bi-elliptical -- the bi-elliptical transfer is actually tri-impulsive.  There are algorithms to refine a bi-impulsive
            transfer into an optimal N-impulse trajectory, which this could feed into, but this is not that.<br>
            The default behavior if you have circular, coplanar orbits is that you just whack "create node" and it acts like the old Hohmann transfer planner,
            only it won't miss if you're off by a bit.  But it will also plan optimal burns between non-coplanar / non-elliptical orbits.  So you can launch
            into an equatorial parking orbit around Kerbin and plan a transfer to Minmus and it will actually hit Minmus now.  It will even plan burns when one
            of the targets is hyperbolic.  That means if you have a ship in a parking orbit and want to do an asteroid capture mission you should just be able
            to select the target and whack "create node" and it'll work and give you the optimum transfer.<br>
            The "intercept only" switch is the sort of "mono-impulsive" case where you don't care about the cost of the second burn.  So if you're going to lob
            a nuke or kinetic interceptor at something, this is what you want.<br>
            The drag down also allows selecting the time of the burn via all the familiar MJ options for selecting the time of a burn.  In that case no
            optimization is done of the departure time and it is fixed.<br>
            A near-future addition to this will probably be allowing textbox entry of transfer windows for the min departure time, max departure time and max transfer time.
            But I hit my limit this weekend.<br>
            A word on what is going on under the hood is that this is a Hard&trade; problem in mathematics to solve.  There are potentially very many basins
            involved in this problem (consider a porkchop plot with potentially a hundred blue basins) and picking the right one, FAST is Hard&trade;.  What I
            threw together uses a simulated annealing global optimization first pass.  This is a stochastic, random algorithm that attempts to search out the
            space randomly, not always necessarily taking optimum steps, but slowly "cooling" towards taking small steps to better positions.  Then there is a
            second pass where the output of the annealing algorithm is fed into Levenburg-Marquardt to just do a gradient search for the best solution in the
            selected basin.<br>
            TL;DR: Random searching is involved.  You may get slightly different results each time you compute the trajectory.  Generally these are off by a
            single orbit in the source or destination orbit, and typically will not be off by more than a few percent in cost.  That isn't really a bug
            (although its possible that further refinement could reduce the jumps).  A standard-looking Hohmann transfer I've found to be reliable.  If you see
            roughly circular, coplanar transfers jump around a <i>lot</i> that would be bad.

        Stabilizer</a> (WorldStabilizer) There's a bug (still in 1.6) that when you enter the scene with a landed vessel, it jumps up in the air (or the lack of
          it).  The root cause seems to be that the game places the vessels slightly beneath the ground and physics kicks in and the ground pushes the vessels
          outwards with significant force. In many cases, especially low-gravity worlds, this is disastrous. This mod intercepts all unpacked (i.e. those
          affected by physics engine) vessels in the scene right before physics is about to kick in, determines if they are "submerged" into the ground, raises
          them slightly above﻿ and slowly releases.

          (ProceduralFairings) - Far better than the stock fairings and engine plates, and adds Apollo S-IVB style interstage fairings. To have the interstage
          fairings separate, the top stage must be connected to the topmost node. You really need to turn the separation forces down. Set the "force percent" to
          10, the "ejection power" to 0, and "ejection torque" to 0.2.<br>
          (You can have stock interstages if you use a separator - not just a decoupler. The truss structure disappears when the top separator fires. You then
          have the stupid separator debris, though...)

    <h3>DLC Missions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Dawn of the Space Age:<br>
        The first mission pounds into you the fact you need to tweak the fuel in the solid rocket motor to come in under the weight limit.<br>
        You get only one chance at designing the Jebnik 1, since you can't go back to the VAB. This is apparently a bug.</li>
      <li>Trouble in the Void:<br>
        An RCS-only rendezvous followed by a pain-in-the-ass EVA, followed by a couple precision landings.</li>
      <li>To the M&uuml;n via Minmus:<br>
        You don't have reaction wheels. Set orbit for 98km. Turn off AoA limit. Turn off auto-warp. Set Utilities to auto-stage. Set Smart-Ass to drive to
        maneuver node. Set Maneuver Planner to circularize. After the first shutdown, turn off ascent guidance, disable the main engine, create a
        circularization node, then make Smart-ASS use the verniers for attitude control, then re-enable the engine for circularization, then disable it
        again. It takes some serious control dancing. Once you get to orbit, you'll have reaction wheels.<br>
        After you're in orbit, enable hibernation on the buried probe core, otherwise you'll run out of electricity.<br>
        You'll need to separate the probe, otherwise it doesn't count as destroyed.<br>
        For the M&uuml;n launch, you need to launch in-plane? I've not gotten that far.</li>
      <li>Meet Me in Zero G:<br>
        Turn off the upper vernier engines on the Agena before launch. They just drive MechJeb into oscillation.<br>
        After that, it's two standard orbits, a rendezvous, docking, and landing. Transfer fuel before undocking.</li>
      <li>Blue M&uuml;n:<br>
        You gotta build things. Nope.</li>
      <li>M&uuml;nar 1:<br>
        You gotta build things. Nope.</li>
      <li>Acapello 15:<br>
        You gotta build things. Nope.</li>

    Switching to map mode while in contact with a tracking station will result in kerbals and/or the vessel being destroyed with a "collided with/crashed into
    Base00/Base01/the surface"
    message. Flags will remain, however. Sometimes if you're lucky, the kerbals will just be tossed high into the air. I filed
