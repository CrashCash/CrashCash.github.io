          is 248hp/liter. The 22mm carburetors had 5 jets. The DOHC engine was no wider than a 4 cylinder at 14" wide and drove a 7-speed transmission. Mike
          Hailwood won all 10 races on it in 1966, and repeated the championship in 1967. This is the engine responsible for the "4 cylinders, 6 speeds" rule.
