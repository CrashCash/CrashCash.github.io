    <ul>
      <li>Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot builds the steam-powered "fardier &agrave; vapeur" which is the first
        self-propelled vehicle.</li>

    <hr>
    <div class="year">1804</div>
    <ul>
      <li>The Isaac de Rivaz engine uses an electric spark to ignite hydrogen to drive a piston, which is the first
        internal combustion engine. The French Academy of Sciences argued that the internal combustion engine would
        never rival the performance of the steam engine.</li>

        than a 4 cylinder at 14" wide and drove a 7-speed transmission. Mike Hailwood won all 10 races on it in 1966,
        and repeated the championship in 1967. This is the engine responsible for the "4 cylinders, 6 speeds" rule.</li>

        they had on hand were not selling quickly. To get themselves off the hook from Ducati, they turned to Associated
        Motor Cycles (AMC) in the UK, and used the leverage of the vast USA market they controlled, informing AMC that
        they would be needing no more of the struggling factory's Matchless motorcycles unless AMC found someone to
        purchase the unwanted Ducati shipment. The effect of Berliner's actions rippled through the UK motorcycle world,
