    <h1>My motorcycles - past and present</h1>
    <p>A little about the bikes I've owned...</p>
    <p>Originally I drove a little Toyota Tercel econo-box. It got me places and didn't cost a lot of money, since I
      knew of a decent shop in Ocala run by a Greek guy who would actually fix things for a decent price. However I'm
      6'2" and I didn't fit in it very well. It also didn't have much power, but the automatic transmission was
      well-matched to the engine, and managed to make it drivable.</p>
    <p>Then I came to Orlando and discovered that the car shops don't do very good work. I didn't have the money or
      ability to keep the Toyota running, as I was pretty much mechanically illiterate. When the timing chain broke and
      instantly put $500 on my new credit card, I had to do something. I was a student and didn't have that kind of
      money.</p>

            Harley-Davidson, and you end up being able to crack walnuts with your left hand. Ugly maroon color. Tire
            valves are <i>right next</i> to the wheel spokes, making it really difficult to check pressure or add air.</p>

            amazingly nice. It looks like a motorcycle, not a spaceship.</p>
          <p><b>Lose:</b> Will no longer charge past 70% after only 2 years. 12 months in the shop. Energica went
            bankrupt. Constant flashing of error messages that the dealer can't fix. Regen flashes the brakelight
            obnoxiously on the slightest deceleration. Keyless ignition stranded me several times. Extremely optimistic
            speedometer says I'm doing 79-80 when the GPS says I'm doing 70. The Givi bags are a one-off design not
            compatible with anything else.</p>

            mirrors work.</p>
          <p><b>Lose:</b> Horribly uncomfortable seat. Fuel gauge doesn't tell you anything if the tank's more than half
            full. Windshield is useless garbage. Cornering lights are dim and useless. Only one headlight is on unless
            you're using high beams. If you've got cornering lights, why don't you have self-canceling turn signals?
            Engine is very gutless for 890cc. The MyRide-Link phone app has 169 1-star reviews and nothing higher.</p>
