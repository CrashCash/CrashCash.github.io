    <h1>The motorcycle special tools I've accumulated</h1>
    <p>These are the motorcycle-specific special tools I've accumulated over the years. This does not include more general purpose tools such as screwdrivers,
      ratchets, sockets, torque wrenches, DMMs, Allen keys, pliers, breaker bars, combo/box wrenches, taps, dies, drills, drill press, etc.</p>
    <p>I have not used some of these tools in 25 years, so digging them up was a trip down memory lane.</p>
    <p>I also learned a lot trying to photograph very small black-on-black tools, and setting up lighting/exposure to match the webpage background.</p>

          <p><b>Purpose:</b> Safely install fork seals.</p>
          <p>This is a clever device which splits to fit around the fork leg, then is held firmly together by half-rings so you can push the fork seals in
            absolutely straight and square without screwing up the lip seal. Also helps put in the big circlips.</p>

          <p>Also known as K&amp;L Tools KL-0526K</p>
          <p>The 2006-2008 FJR-1300s had three fork bushings instead of the usual two, and you need this tool to install two of them. This was a VERY difficult
            tool to acquire. I had to go through Yamaha Corporate in California, and I had to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau to get them to
            let me order it.</p>

          <p><b>Purpose:</b> I bought this 30 years ago to get the clutch off the RZ-350.</p>
          <p>IT IS A BEAST. It weighs about 10lbs and has never met a fastener it couldn't loosen, including the FJR's clutch basket nut. It went BRAAAPPP and

          <p><b>Cost:</b> $265</p>
          <p><b>Purpose:</b> Hold the front wheel of the FJR & SR when I get home to save space in my small garage.</p>
          <p>This is an ingenious design that uses a pneumatic arm instead of the standard "tilting bucket" design to hold the wheel. This means there's no need
            to force the bike over a large hump. You just roll the bike in and step on a pedal. I bought the #2A for the FJR and I was so pleased with the first
            one that I bought a #3 for the SR, but it doesn't fit as well.</p>

          <h3>Baxley sport check</h3>
          <p><b>Cost:</b> $250</p>
          <p><b>Purpose:</b> Hold the front wheel of the FJR.</p>
          <p>This is the standard "tilting bucket" design. It's really well made, but has two problems. First, you have to push the bike over a large
            hump. Second, the bucket has a tendency to flip up, so the bike bounces off when you try to roll it in. I added springs to stop this.</p>
          <p>I used this to hold the FJR on the Harbor Freight lift, and one day, I couldn't see the bucket had reset because of the fairing, and the bike
            bounced off and away from me. Trying to save it, my hand got pushed into the tool pegboard and I needed several stitches. Fortunately, the FJR came
            to rest gently on the engine case and was not damaged. I had to fashion a lifting arrangement out of some steel plumbing pipes and ratchet straps to
            bring it back upright.</p>
          <p>That's when I started searching for something better and got the Wheeldocks.</p>
