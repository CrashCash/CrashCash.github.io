    <h1>Tire lift tool</h1>
    <p>I do all the maintenance on my bikes by myself, so I'm at a disadvantage when I'm changing my tires. Normally I
      need to lift and hold a 30 pound tire & wheel in place accurately enough to slide in the axle, while dealing with
      spacers, brake brackets, ABS sensors and what-not.</p>
    <p>I knocked together a quick hack from pipes and a cheap Chinese lever hoist. It happens to fit on the lift.</p>
    <p>This reverses the process, where I'm able to position the bike where I need it to be.</p>
    <p>It's pretty sketchy, so I don't leave the bike hanging there long.</p>
    <p><b>Use a front tire chock or rear stand to stabilize things.</b></p>
