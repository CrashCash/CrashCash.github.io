    <h1>Tire lift tool</h1>
    <p>I do all the maintenance on my bikes by myself, so I'm at a disadvantage when I'm putting a rear wheel back in place. I need to lift and hold a 30 pound
      tire & wheel in place accurately enough to slide in the axle, while dealing with spacers, brake brackets, ABS sensors and what-not.</p>
    <p>I knocked together a quick hack from the cargo strapping used on semi trailers. The wide strap fits easily under the tire, and the ratchet mechanism
      holds it and allows fine position adjustments.</p>
    <p>This is most useful with a bike lift, but you can use it on the ground, as well.</p>

          <p>I bought the main components from Northern Tool + Equipment.</p>
          <p>The "Buyers Standard Bolt-On Winch, Model#1903020" and "SmartStraps Winch Strap with Flat Hook-30ftx4in, Model#285" are both $30.</p>
          <p>You want the bolt-on winch so you can bolt it to the carrier, and you want the 4&quot; wide strap to better fit under the tire.</p>
          <p>Construct an L-shaped carrier from 1x6 pine and corner brackets.</p>
          <p>It needs to be at least as tall as the height of the axle on whatever bike stand you're using.</p>
          <p>Drill 1/2" holes and bolt the winch to the carrier with 1/2"x1-1/2" bolts and washers.</p>
          <p>Make sure the ratchet is facing the correct way up.</p>
          <p>Shorten the strap as necessary, and use a flame to melt the end to keep it from unraveling.</p>

          <p>I used a long 3/8" ratchet extension as a support rod.</p>
          <p>Insert support rod into the passenger footpeg brackets.</p>
          <p>You can also put the support rod directly on the swingarm.</p>
          <p>Hook the end of the strap over the rod.</p>
          <p>Lay the strap under the wheel's path, and move the rest of the tool out of the way.</p>
