    <h1>Tracer 9 GT+ software update file format</h1>
    You can obtain software updates for your Yamaha Tracer from:<br>
    <a href="https://www.yamaha-motor.eu/kv/en/service-support/connectivity/ccu-updates/">https://www.yamaha-motor.eu/kv/en/service-support/connectivity/ccu-updates/</a><br>
    <br>
    This is a zip file, similar to a Java JAR.<br>
    <br>
    It has a "manifest.xml" file that tells you what the other files are, and a "manifest.sig" which probably contains a
    digital signature.<br>
    <br>
    The product is "yamaha-lyww20" and lyww20 is apparently Yamaha's internal code name for the Tracer 9 GT+<br>
    If you google this, you get "Garmin Communication Control Unit LYWW20" which apparently a "motorcycle link box" that
    does Bluetooth and Wi-Fi using a Marvell chipset<br>
    <br>
    One of the files is a Linux ext4 filesystem image. This can be mounted with<br>
    <code>mount -o ro,loop gear-image-garmin-sta1295-lawrence-lyww20.ext4 /mnt/temp</code><br>
    <br>
    This is an entire bootable Linux system, compiled for 32-bit Cortex-A7 ARM v7 hard-float processors (according to
    <code>readelf -a /bin/bash</code>) with systemd, wayland, and mosquitto<br><br>
    According to some of the config files, mosquitto exposes the odometer, fuel level, coolant temperature, and other
    things.<br><br>
    It uses Wayland for the display, which is a successor to X11 (X Windows)<br><br>
    It has MiracleCast, which is probably how the Garmin navigation software displays on the bike. This is open source,
    so I wonder if I could write something to display on the bike?<br><br>
    /etc/garmin-part-number<br>
    006-B3195-00<br>
    I could find nothing useful on Google.<br>
    <br>
    /etc/os-release:<br>
    ID="gear"<br>
    NAME="Poky (Yocto Project Reference Distro)"<br>
    VERSION="2.2.4 (morty)"<br>
    VERSION_ID="2.2.4"<br>
    PRETTY_NAME="Poky (Yocto Project Reference Distro) 2.2.4 (morty)"<br><br>
    I was able to discover it has Gracenote media ID/metadata management software, and the FrogLogic Squish commercial
    cross-platform GUI and regression testing tool installed in /opt, neither of which are mentioned in the software
    licenses UI.
