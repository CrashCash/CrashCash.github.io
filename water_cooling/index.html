    <h2>Computer Water Cooling Flow</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Water exits pump</b>
        <ul>
          <li>The pump is a <a href="https://www.ekwb.com/blog/which-pump-should-you-use-d5-or-ddc/" target="_blank">D5 pump</a> in the bottom of the tube
            reservoir. The pump is lubricated by the water, so it's quickly damaged if it runs dry. This style of reservoir guarantees that won't happen.</li>
          <li>It's much easier to fill and monitor the water level than other types.</li>
          <li>The reservoir is mounted in a rubber bushing to isolate pump vibration, and bolted to a 120mm fan bay.</li>
          <li>The long water lines allow the reservoir to be removed and flipped over to easily drain the entire system, so the usual T-drain is not needed.</li>
          <li>The pump is controlled by the motherboard fan PWM output, so when the CPU gets hotter, the BIOS spins up the pump.</li>
          <li>The case is an NZXT Tempest 410, which has space for the radiator on top, and holes for the half-inch water lines.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Enters bottom of CPU water block</b><br>
        This water block replaces the usual fan and heatsink.</li>
      <li><b>Exits top of CPU water block</b><br>
        This flow direction removes air bubbles.</li>
      <li><b>Enters chipset water block</b><br>
        This replaces a very large heatsink usually mounted here on this motherboard.</li>
      <li><b>Exits chipset water block</b></li>
      <li><b>Enters <a href="radiator.html" target="_blank">radiator</a></b></li>
      <li><b>Exits radiator</b></li>
      <li><b>Enters water reservoir</b><br>
        And the loop is closed.</li>
    </ol>
