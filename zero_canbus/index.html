    <h1>Zero Motorcycles CANBUS information</h1>
    I went to Daytona during Bike Week on my 2015 SR.<br>
    I found out that the bike would make it from Orlando to Daytona without charging, which was a surprise.<br>
    This was a surprise because I stop to charge the bike far more often than I need to, since I don't really have a mental handle on the range versus distance
    to the things I'm interested in.<br>
    The range *says* I can get to Daytona. Does it mean it? Can I trust it? It would be nice if I had real-time feedback.<br><br>
    I figured I needed to write an Android app to display a map with a range circle continuously updated from the bike.<br>
    This meant I needed to buckle down and decode the CANBUS data, if possible.<br><br>
    I managed to decode not only the range, but also the speed, mode selected (sport/eco/custom), motor temp, motor RPM, and the error number(s) on dash.<br><br>
    CANBUS is available on the OBD-II connector located above and behind the motor next to the accessory charging port, on the right-hand side.<br>
    On my 2015, it's buried deep in there. It's like birthing a cow. On the newer models, it's under the seat.
    <h3>Installation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Bolt <a href="http://copperhilltech.com/pican2-duo-can-bus-board-for-raspberry-pi-2/" target="_blank">PiCAN 2 Duo board</a> ($70) to Raspberry Pi<br>
        I should have actually used a plain <a href="http://copperhilltech.com/pican-2-can-interface-for-raspberry-pi/" target="_blank">PiCan 2</a> for $47 and
        ended up with a nice DB-9 connector to plug directly to the SparkFun cable.
      </li>
      <li>
        I'm not going to go into much detail on the Raspberry Pi stuff because there's tons of tutorials that explain things far better than I can.<br>
        Also, since my desktop environment is Debian Linux, I don't how you would do things like ssh or scp in Windows.
      </li>
      <li>
        Install Raspbian Jessie Lite on the SD card.<br>
        Note that ssh is now disabled by default, as per
        <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/a-security-update-for-raspbian-pixel/" target="_blank">https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/a-security-update-for-raspbian-pixel/</a><br>
        This kills me because I usually use my Raspberry Pis headless (without a keyboard and monitor) so I can't just run raspi-config and enable ssh.<br>
        To enable ssh, loopback-mount the image on your Linux box, and put a file named "ssh" in the /boot directory on the VFAT partition. This enables it for
        the next boot only, so be sure to immediately enable ssh permanently through raspi-config.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hook the Raspberry Pi up to USB power and your ethernet, boot it up and enable ssh through raspi-config.
      </li>
      <li>Edit /boot/config.txt and add:<br>
        <code>
          dtparam=spi=on<br>
          dtoverlay=mcp2515-can0,oscillator=16000000,interrupt=25<br>
          dtoverlay=mcp2515-can1,oscillator=16000000,interrupt=24<br>
          dtoverlay=spi-bcm2835-overlay
        </code>
      </li>
      <li>Bring the interfaces up in /etc/rc.local<br>
        <code>
          ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 500000<br>
          ip link set can1 up type can bitrate 500000
        </code>
      </li>
      <li>Edit /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf and add the wi-fi info for your network as per
        <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md" target="_blank">https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md</a><br>
        This is so you can ssh into it when it's in your saddlebag and not physically connected to your ethernet.<br>
        I also added an entry for the portable hotspot on my Android phone, so I could communicate with it when I was away from my home network.<br>
        I use the ConnectBot app to ssh to the Raspberry Pi from the phone.<br>
        Note that when you're using the Android portable hotspot, you can use the "arp" command on the phone (or look at /proc/net/arp) to see the IP addresses
        of attached devices like the Pi, so you know where to ssh.
      </li>
      <li>Fetch test software<br>
        <code>
          wget http://www.skpang.co.uk/dl/can-test_pi2.zip<br>
        </code>
        Unzip it, set the executable bits, and copy to /usr/local/bin<br>
        You probably want to just delete "cansend" for safety's sake.<br>
        Actually to say it stronger: DON'T EVER TRANSMIT DATA USING CANSEND
      </li>
      <li>Install Python 3.x CANBUS module<br>
        <code>
          apt-get install python3-pip<br>
          pip3 install python-can
        </code>
      </li>
      <li>Connect the PiCAN2 to the CANBUS via screw terminal and an OBD-II cable.<br>
        You can get the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10087" target="_blank">SparkFun OBD-II to DB-9 Cable p/n CAB-10087</a> for $10<br>
        I just cut the DB-9 off the cable and toned the wires with the DMM continuity function to find pins 6 (red wire) & 14 (yellow wire)
      </li>
      <li>Throw the Raspberry Pi in a saddlebag, and connect the USB power either to a portable battery, or to a USB converter in the "cigarette lighter" jack.<br>
        If you use the bike power jack, then you must ssh to the Raspberry Pi and shut it down gracefully using "poweroff" before turning the bike off, or you
        can corrupt the SD card.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Using candump</h3>
    Store traffic for analysis by using:<br>
    <code>
      candump -e can0 >dump.txt<br>
    </code>
    <br>
    You get output like:<br>
    <pre>
      can0  1C0   [8]  20 00 10 07 17 48 72 00
      can0  408   [8]  00 1A 19 01 00 61 00 FF
      can0  080   [0]

      can0  440   [8]  BC E2 01 00 CC 2B 5C 12
      can0  540   [8]  00 00 00 00 67 16 CA 1B
      can0  3C0   [6]  85 55 02 00 00 00
      can0  189   [8]  61 00 42 56 00 02 00 01
    </pre>
    Note that everything is in hexidecimal (base 16)<br>
    Each line is a "message"<br>
    1st column is the interface name.<br>
    2nd column is the PID (Parameter ID)<br>
    3rd column is the number of data bytes<br>
    4th column is data byte #0<br>
    5th column is data byte #1<br>
    ...<br>
    11th column is data byte #7<br><br>
    candump tricks:<br>
    Only show messages with PID 0x123:<br>
    <code>
      candump can0,0x123:0x7FF<br>
    </code>
    <br>
    Only show messages with PID 0x123 or PID 0x456:<br>
    <code>
      candump can0,0x123:0x7FF,0x456:0x7FF<br>
    </code>
    <br>
    You can also visually monitor data in real time with cansniffer.<br><br>
    The command "<code>awk '{ print $2 }' dump.txt | sort | uniq</code>" shows the following PIDs repeat continously:<br>
    0x080, 0x181, 0x188, 0x189, 0x1C0, 0x240, 0x281, 0x288, 0x289, 0x2C0, 0x308, 0x309, 0x340, 0x381, 0x388, 0x389, 0x3C0, 0x408, 0x409, 0x440, 0x481, 0x488,
    0x489, 0x501, 0x506, 0x508, 0x509, 0x540, 0x701<br><br>
    The brake switches do not appear to be connected to the CANBUS. Nothing seems to change in candump/cansniffer.<br><br>
    Note that when you spin the rear wheel, the speed & motor RPM both update on the dashboard.<br>
    Speed is probably calculated from RPM based on the sprocket sizes (belt reduction) and nominal tire circumference.<br><br>
    I wrote <a href="print_range" target="_blank">print_range</a> to run on the Raspberry Pi from the phone, so I could display the range from CANBUS while I
    rode, and confirm it matched the dashboard.<br>
    That is, I enabled the Android portable wi-fi hotspot, ssh-ed into the Raspberry Pi from the phone, and ran print_range. This continuously prints output,
    and I could then mount the phone on the bike with the RAM mount and ride down the road.<br>
    This is also an example of how to fetch and decode CANBUS data in a Python script.<br><br>
    There is different traffic when the bike is charging, but I didn't look at that much.<br><br>
    Next up on the plate is getting a ELM-327 based Bluetooth OBD-II dongle working with an Android range display app. Unfortunately, Zero does not supply power
    on pin 16 like they should, so I need to rig up power for it.
    <h3>Known info for each PID</h3>
    <hr>
    <b>0x080</b><br>
    No data bytes. Some sort of timing/sync?<br>
    <hr>
    <b>0x240</b><br>
    Current riding mode == byte 0<br>
    0x85 (133) (binary 1000 0101) Sport<br>

    0x91 (145) (binary 1001 0001) Custom<br>
    I noticed this with cansniffer.<br><br>
    Speed (km/hr) == (byte 2+256*byte 3)/100<br>
    Used same procedure as range.<br>
    <hr>
    <b>0x281</b><br>
    Motor temp (degrees C) == byte 6<br>
    Used same procedure as range.<br>
    Good thing I realized it's metric, because the C=(F-32)x5/9 crap would have killed me.<br>
    <hr>
    <b>0x340</b><br>
    Motor revolutions (RPM) == byte 4+256*byte 5<br>
    Used same procedure as range.<br><br>
    Error readout on dash == byte 6<br>
    0x00 (0)  No faults<br>
    0x2C (44) Kill switch on<br>
    0x2D (45) Kickstand down<br>
    ...<br>
    (See manual for complete list)<br>
    One transmission for every error, so if there's 2 errors, there will be 2 0x340 frames.<br>
    I noticed this with cansniffer.<br>
    <hr>
    <b>0x440</b><br>
    This is a two-byte "word" value least-significant-byte first, in units of "10 meters"<br>
    This tells me the architecture is metric and little-endian, which is valuable information.<br><br>
    range (km) == (byte 4+256*byte 5)/100<br>
    range (miles) == (byte 4+256*byte 5)/160.9<br><br>
    The procedure I used to decode it:
    <ol>
      <li>I filmed the dashboard range display with my phone on several rides. I also ran candump.</li>
      <li>I pulled an image every second from the videos:<br>
        <code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf fps=1 out%05d.png</code></li>
      <li>I reduced this by hand to a text file with the range and the frame it changed using geeqie and emacs.<br>
        As you can imagine, this was a lot of work, dealing with over 1200 frames on one ride.<br><br>
        <code>
        78.2,1<br>
        78.3,46<br>
        78.2,56<br>

        78.2,66<br>
        78.4,71<br>
        78.5,81<br>
        78.7,86<br>
        ...</code></li>
      <li>I imported this into a spreadsheet and charted it.</li>
      <li>I wrote <a href="gen_graphs" target="_blank">gen_graphs</a> to graph all the single and both double-byte representations of every possible slice of
        the data for each PID from the candump output.</li>
      <li>I compared the chart with all of the generated graphs until I found one where the shape matched.</li>
      <li>I experimented until I realized the unit was metric to make the numbers match. This took a while because my original data was in miles. When I divided
        it by 161 and it matched, I was wondering why the weird constant, then I remembered that there's 1,609 meters in a mile and figured out it was
        metric.</li>
